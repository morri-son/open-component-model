# OCM Monorepo Release Strategy - Team Discussion

**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Develop shared understanding for new release strategy  

---

## üéØ Summary

### Current Status

We have started migrating our codebase to a monorepo. This monorepo contains multiple OCM v2 components

- `cli` - CLI v2
- `kubernetes/controller` - controller v2
- `website` (future, currently developed in own repository)

### Goal

Establish coordinated release process for multiple components out of a monorepo with a clear strategy for versioning, branching, and releasing. Enable an `ocm` product component introduced later to be released in a straightforward manner.

### Solution

The approach combines:

**Lockstep for SemVer:** All components share MAJOR.MINOR versions, independent PATCH releases possible.  
**Unified Branching:** Single release branch per MINOR version for coordinated releases.  
**Evolutionary Implementation:** Start simple with proven patterns, evolve to full scope and automation.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Implementation Philosophy: Start Simple, Evolve

**Core Principle:** Begin with proven patterns, evolve based on experience

**Why this approach:**

- Focuses on ability to release existing components quickly and reliably.
- Reduces initial complexity and implementation risk.
- Leverages lessons learned from OCM v1 release experience.
- Allows team to focus on process before tooling complexity.

### 2. Lockstep SemVer Versioning

**Rule:** All components share same MAJOR.MINOR, independent PATCH releases

**Why lockstep?**

- High likelihood of required changes across components every sprint (if not features, then dependencies).
- Simplifies the overall release process.
- Versioning of a later `ocm` product component is straightforward.

```text
cli/v0.9.0, controller/v0.9.0, ocm/v0.9.0     ‚Üê coordinated release
cli/v0.9.1, controller/v0.9.0, ocm/v0.9.1     ‚Üê independent patch later
```

### 3. Release Roles & Responsibilities

**Release Manager:** Orchestrates sprint releases, coordinates RC promotions, decides on emergency patches.  
**Maintainers:** Ensure component readiness, approve backports, validate release quality.  
**TSC (Technical Steering Committee):** Sign-off for high-risk changes and major decisions.

**Decision Gates:**

- **RC ‚Üí Release Promotion:** Release Manager decision, with maintainer sign-off.
- **Emergency Release Approval:** Release Manager decision (critical CVSS (‚â• 9) or business critical).
- **Backport Authorization:** Maintainer approval required.
- **Major Policy Changes:** TSC approval for e.g., changes in support policy.

### 4. Release Notes

**Approach:** Automated per-component release notes

- Path-based change detection, e.g., `cli/**` ‚Üí CLI release notes (avoid additional component-scoped labels)  
  
### 5. Release Cadence

**4-Week Cycle:** 2 weeks development + 2 weeks RC testing ‚Üí orchestrated release.
**Maintenance:** y-2 policy (current + 2 previous MINOR versions) ???  
**Emergency:** Critical fixes (CVSS ‚â• 9 or business critical) can be released anytime.

### 6. Testing Strategy

Component-Level Tests: Each component has individual tests running
Integration Tests: End-to-end tests validating sub-components work together, e.g. create and transfer a component using the CLI and then deploy it using the controller.

## üöÄ Key Decisions We Need to Make

### Decision 1: Version Storage

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | **Recommendation** |
|--------|-------------|------|------|-------------------|
| **V1: VERSION Files** | `cli/VERSION`, `controller/VERSION` | ‚úÖ Explicit and readable<br>‚úÖ Faster implementation | ‚ùå Extra commits needed<br>‚ùå Potential VERSION/tag drift | üü° **Recommended** *(Start simple)* |
| **V2: Git Tags only** | Only tags: `cli/v2.1.0` | ‚úÖ Single source of truth<br>‚úÖ No version bump commits | ‚ùå More complex automation<br>‚ùå Requires robust `git describe` | üü¢ **Target Solution** *(Long-term goal)* |

**Proposal:** Start with V1 for faster initial implementation, re-using principles learned in OCM v1, migrate to V2 once automation is mature.

### Decision 2: Branching Strategy

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | **Recommendation** |
|--------|-------------|------|------|-------------------|
| **B0: One Branch per Minor** | `releases/2.1` for all components | ‚úÖ Simple coordination | ‚ùå Discipline required | üü¢ **Recommended** *(Best fit)* |
| **B1: Branch per Component** | `releases/cli/2.1` `releases/controller/2.1` | ‚úÖ Clear separation | ‚ùå More branches to manage | üü° **Alternative** *(If needed)* |
| **B2: Tags Only** | Temporary branches for patches | ‚úÖ Minimal overhead | ‚ùå Complex automation<br>‚ùå No patch baseline history | üî¥ **Not Recommended** *(Too complex)* |

**Proposal:** Start with B0 (unified branch) for simplicity, reducing overhead and coordination benefits.

## üóìÔ∏è Example Workflow: Sprint Cycle

**Context:** All release operations happen in release branches (`releases/X.Y` or `releases/<component>/X.Y`, depending on decision B0/B1) and will be supported by GitHub workflows.

### Sprint N: Development Phase (2 weeks)

```bash
# Create release branch from main for new minor version
git checkout main
git checkout -b releases/v0.9
git push origin releases/v0.9

# Create RCs for all components
# Triggered by GitHub Actions workflow
cli/v0.9.0-rc.1
kubernetes/controller/v0.9.0-rc.1
```

### Sprint N+1: RC Testing Phase (2 weeks)

```bash
# Bug found in CLI during RC testing
git checkout releases/v0.9
git cherry-pick <bugfix>

# Increment RC versions for affected components
cli/v0.9.0-rc.2                     ‚Üê RC incremented due to patch
kubernetes/controller/v0.9.0-rc.1   ‚Üê unchanged
```

### Sprint N+1 End: Orchestrated Release Day

**Release Manager orchestrates:** All current RCs get promoted to finals

```bash
# All RCs become finals simultaneously
cli/v0.9.0 
kubernetes/controller/v0.9.0

# Start next cycle - create new release branch + RCs
releases/v0.10 ‚Üí cli/v0.10.0-rc.1, controller/v0.10.0-rc.1
```

**Emergency patches:** Can be released immediately with shorter RC phase as decided by Release Manager.

### Maintenance Patches (Separate Workflow)

```bash
# Security fix for previous cli release (already finalized)
git checkout releases/0.8  # previous release branch
git cherry-pick <security-fix>

# Create patch RCs for maintenance release
cli/v0.8.1-rc.1
kubernetes/controller/v0.8.0  ‚Üê keep same version if unaffected

# Options for promoting these maintenance RCs if we keep all releases coordinated:
- next orchestrated release day (RC period < 2 weeks, potentially very short)
- the second-next orchestrated release day (RC period > 2 weeks)
```

## ‚ùì Discussion Points

### Key Decisions Needed

1. **Version Storage:** V1 (VERSION files) or direct V2 (Git tags)?
2. **Branching Strategy:** B0 (unified branch) or B1 (per-component branches) or B2 (tags only)?
3. **Support Policy Details:** Confirm y-2 policy specifics, branch retirement, and other EOL procedures

### Open Questions

1. **Integration tests vs conformance tests:** Naming and scope of root component tests
2. **Without integration tests:** How do we ensure component compatibility in Phase 1?
3. **Emergency criteria:** What exactly constitutes an emergency release beyond CVSS ‚â• 9?
